# Key R Packages for Data Import

packages,write up on R package (2line), example, pros and cons

-   

    1.  Base R (read.csv, read.table)

Example: mydata \<- read.csv("data.csv") Pros: No installation required; works for simple, small files. Cons: Slow with large or complex datasets.

-   

    2.  readr (tidyverse)

Example: library(readr) data \<- read_csv("data.csv") Pros: Fast, efficient, clear error messages, good for large files. Cons: Focused on delimited text files.

-   

    3.  readxl and openxlsx (Excel)

Example: library(readxl) excel_data \<- read_excel("data.xlsx") Pros: Reads both .xls and .xlsx, no need for Excel/Java. Cons: Not suited for very large Excel files.

-   

    4.  haven (SPSS, Stata, SAS)

Example: library(haven) spss_data \<- read_sav("file.sav") Pros: Preserves metadata and labels; integrates with tidyverse. Cons: Limited to statistical formats.

-   

    5.  data.table::fread

Example: library(data.table) big_data \<- fread("largefile.csv") Pros: Extremely fast; auto-detects delimiters. Cons: Slightly different syntax.

-   

    6.  rio Rio, which stands for "R Input Output" is a user-friendly R package designed to simplify the process of importing and exporting data between R and a wide variety of file formats.

rio provides a single, easy-to-use function (import()) that automatically detects the file type and uses the appropriate backend package to read the data into R.

Example: library(rio) any_data \<- import("file.xlsx") Pros: One function for almost all formats. Cons: Less control for advanced customizations.
